# Skytab Integration Guide

Welcome to the Skytab integration guide! This guide will help you assist customers with connecting their Skytab POS system to Pivot for employee and sales data synchronization.

## What is Skytab?

Skytab is a Point of Sale (POS) system by Shift4 Payments. When integrated with Pivot, it allows businesses to:

- **Sync employee data** between their POS and Pivot
- **Track sales automatically** with hourly updates
- **View historical sales data** for reporting and analysis
- **Link POS employees** to Pivot profiles for better workforce management

## Setting Up the Integration

### How Customers Connect Skytab to Pivot

The integration can only be initiated from the Skytab Marketplace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Skytab">
    The customer needs to access their Skytab account and navigate to the Shift4 Marketplace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Pivot">
    In the marketplace, search for "Pivot" or browse the available integrations to find the Pivot app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Install">
    Click the "Install" button on the Pivot integration. This will redirect them to Pivot automatically.
    <Warning>The customer has 15 minutes to complete the setup once they click Install.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Company ID">
    When redirected to Pivot, they'll be prompted to enter their Pivot Company ID. This connects their Skytab location to the correct Pivot account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Once completed, they'll see a success message. The integration is now active and will begin syncing data automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>If the customer doesn't know their Company ID, they can find it in Pivot under Account Settings → Company Info.</Tip>

## Managing Employees

### Linking Employees to Skytab

Once the integration is set up, customers can link their Pivot employees to their Skytab POS profiles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Employee Profile">
    Navigate to any employee's profile in Pivot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Skytab ID Field">
    Look for the "Skytab ID" field in the employee information section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Employee">
    Click on the field and type at least 3 letters of the employee's name as it appears in Skytab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select from Results">
    A dropdown will appear with matching employees from Skytab. Select the correct employee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    The Skytab ID will be saved automatically, linking the two profiles.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>The search looks for matches in both first and last names. If an employee isn't found, verify their name is entered correctly in Skytab.</Info>

## Sales Data

### Understanding Sales Synchronization

Pivot automatically collects sales data from Skytab to help with labor cost analysis and reporting:

- **Hourly Updates**: Sales data is collected every hour automatically
- **Timezone Aware**: Data is synced based on the company's timezone setting
- **Historical Data**: Past sales data can be imported when needed

### Viewing Sales Data

Customers can view their Skytab sales data in Pivot through:

1. **Dashboard**: Real-time sales appear on the main dashboard
2. **Labor Cost Analysis**: Sales vs. labor cost comparisons in the Payroll section

<Note>Sales data typically appears within an hour of transactions being completed in Skytab.</Note>

## Disconnecting the Integration

### Option 1: Disconnect from Pivot

Customers can remove the integration directly from Pivot:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to Account Settings → Integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Skytab">
    Locate the Skytab card in the POS Systems section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Disconnect">
    Click the "Disconnect" button on the Skytab card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the disconnection when prompted. This removes the integration from both Pivot and Skytab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Uninstall from Skytab Marketplace

Customers can also remove the integration from Skytab:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Skytab Marketplace">
    Log into Skytab and go to the Shift4 Marketplace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="My Apps">
    Navigate to "My Apps" or "Installed Apps" section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Pivot">
    Locate Pivot in the list of installed applications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Uninstall">
    Click "Uninstall" or "Remove". Pivot will be notified automatically and the integration will be disconnected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Disconnecting the integration will stop all data synchronization. Historical data already in Pivot will remain, but no new data will be imported.</Warning>
