# ADP Integration Guide

Welcome to the ADP integration guide! This document walks you through how Pivot connects with ADP to streamline your payroll and employee management processes.

## What is ADP Integration?

ADP integration allows you to seamlessly connect your Pivot account with ADP's payroll and HR systems. This means you can:

- **Search and link employees** from your ADP system directly in Pivot
- **Export payroll data** from Pivot to ADP automatically
- **Synchronize employee information** between both platforms
- **Authenticate users** through ADP's secure login system


## Setting Up ADP Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to integration">
    Go to your Account Settings and click on the "Integrations" tab. Find the ADP integration card in the Payroll Systems section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Your Account">
    Click the "Link" button on the ADP integration card. You'll be redirected to the ADP Marketplace to complete the subscription process.
    <Accordion title="Don't forget to write the companyId during the link process on ADP">
        <img src="/_assets/logo/logo_pivot.png"/>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Setup">
    Once you complete the marketplace process, Pivot will automatically:
    - Store your ADP credentials securely
    - Fetch your employee list from ADP
    - Match existing Pivot employees with ADP employees- Set up the integration mapping
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Searching for Employees

When you need to link an employee to their ADP record:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Employee Profile">
Navigate to the employee's profile in Pivot and click on the ADP ID field.
</Step>
<Step title="Search for the Employee">
Type at least 3 characters of the employee's name. The search is automatically debounced (waits 500ms) to avoid excessive API calls.
</Step>
<Step title="Select and Link">
Choose the correct employee from the dropdown. The ADP ID will be automatically stored in the employee's record.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip> The search uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact name - partial matches work great!</Tip>

## Exporting Payroll Data

To send payroll data from Pivot to ADP:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Payroll">
Go to your Payroll section in Pivot and prepare your payroll data as usual.
</Step>
<Step title="Export to ADP">
Click the "Export to ADP" button. Pivot will automatically format and send the data to ADP.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify in ADP">
Check your ADP system to confirm the data was received. The payroll data will be available for processing in ADP.
</Step>
</Steps>

## ADP Marketplace

<Tip>This will remove all ADP employee mappings and integration settings. You can always reconnect later if needed.</Tip>

## User Authentication

### ADP Login Flow

Employees can log in to Pivot using their ADP credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose ADP Login">
    On the login page, select "Login with ADP". You'll be redirected to ADP's secure login page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with ADP">
    Enter your ADP username and password and authorize Pivot to access your information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Pivot">
    You'll be automatically redirected back to Pivot and your account will be created or updated automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>All authentication happens through ADP's secure OAuth system, so Pivot never sees your ADP password.</Tip>
